A dedicated computer that provides services on behalf of clients. A centralized machine where multiple clients either over the internet or a local network can access the same resources. For example, email server, file server, web server, etc. Servers can be dedicated to a single purpose (normally seen in larger orgs) or multiple purposes (normally seen in smaller orgs).

- A server is arole that a computer plays, not a specific type or powerful of computer.
- Servers normally do have to be specialized computers due to large amounts of data and traffic. 
- Servers need to be operational 24/7 as they are vital to the organization. 
    - If a server goes down, it jeopardizes the entire organization. Servers need to be as reliable and robust as possible.
- A server typically needs hardware designed for servers
    - Multi processing environment (multiple processors) motherboard + CPU
    - ECC RAM (Error Correcting Code) - detects and corrects errors in RAM
    - RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) - multiple hard drives that work together to provide redundancy and speed
    - Hot Swap - ability to replace a hard drive without shutting down the server
    - Redundant Power Supply - multiple power supplies that work together to provide redundancy and speed
    - Server operating system - Windows Server, Linux, etc. - Robust and stable - 1000 concurrent connections
